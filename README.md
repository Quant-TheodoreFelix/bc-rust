# The Bouncy Castle Crypto Package For Rust

> [!WARNING]
> This package is currently in ALPHA, meaning that it is not complete or production-ready and will be evolving rapidly over the coming months.
> We are releasing only a small set of cryptographic algorithms in order to get feedback from the community on the API and build structure.


The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Rust implementation of cryptographic algorithms, it was developed by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle, a registered Australian Charity, with a little help! The Legion, and the latest goings on with this package, can be found at https://www.bouncycastle.org.

The aim of this package is to bring the Bouncy Castle team's experience building easy-to-use and FIPS-validated cryptography to Rust. The build system is designed so that you can build the entire library, a single algorithm, or anything in between. It also comes with a command-line interface for all the supported algorithms.

## Docs and Benches

During ALPHA, we're just publishing docs and benchmark results unofficially on github.

Rust crate docs are available here: https://bcgit.github.io/bc-rust/bouncycastle/

Benchmark data is available here: https://bcgit.github.io/bc-rust/benches/report/index.html

## Roadmap

This alpha release includes the following cryptographic primitives:

* Hex (constant-time)
* Base64 (constant-time)
* SHA-2
* SHA-3
* HMAC
* HKDF
* The NIST HashDRBG random number generator

But more than anything, the alpha release focuses on the design of the public trait and error type system contained in the `core-interface` sub-crate.

Next up will be to round out the set of cryptographic primitives:

* Block ciphers (AES)
* Signatures (Ed25519, Ed448, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA)
* Key Establishment (X25519, X448, ML-KEM)

(yes, you have noticed that RSA, ECDSA and ECDH are not on the list. I suppose we could, but we'd really rather not.)

After that, we'll tackle in some kind of order (depending on public interest and funding):

* PKIX (DER, X.509, CMS, CMP)
* TLS 1.3
* C foreign function interface to link to openssl as a provider (rustle)
* JWT & CWT
* FIPS certification framework and test harnesses
* Refining the library's build system (no_std, feature granularity, build and release packaging, etc)

## Community feedback is most welcome!

As this is an alpha release, we're eagerly looking for feedback from the community. We would especially like feedback on the following areas:

* Public API ergonomics and granularity of exposed functionality.
* Certification / compliance concerns.
* Prioritization of roadmap items above.

## Building

This project is structured as a cargo workspace with each cryptographic algorithm segmented into a sub-crate.

You can build the main library and the `bc-rust` command-line utility with:

```
cargo build
```

Or you can build a single sub-crate by name, for example:

```
cargo build -p sha3
```

... or any other cargo magic that you wish :)
